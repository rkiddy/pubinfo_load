These files have been downloaded from ftp://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/bill/pubinfo_load.zip.

The State of California may change these files in the future, but probably no more than every couple of years. The modification date of this

These files purport to allow you to install the legislative data from the CA State Legislature web-site, but they are obviously created to
run on Windows. Since there are people in California using other operating systems, and since I am one of them, I am fixing these files to
work with other operating systems.

I personally use Mac OS X and Ubuntu and will be trying to make sure these scripts work on those systems.

More to come.
